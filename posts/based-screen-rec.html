      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        Most normies use OBS Studio as a screen recorder. And that's fine, it's a great program. But for us minimalist zoomers, OBS is way too much bloat. 
        After dumpster diving I have found the based screen recorders, for Xorg and Wayland.
      </p>

      <h2>Why Am I Making This?</h2>
      <p>
        It's simple — lots of people can't get OBS working. OBS is laggy, bloated, and just bad. 
        With these minimalist screen recorders, however, you can have some shell scripting fun and a fast screen recording experience.
      </p>

      <h2>Xorg - FFMPEG</h2>
      <p>
        Probably the best screen recording tool ever, because it's more than just a screen recorder. You can do all sorts of stuff with ffmpeg and tweak every little thing.
        I'm even pretty sure OBS is just a GUI wrapper for ffmpeg :) It’s fast, minimal, and “Just Works.”
        You’d combine it with <code>x11grab</code> to get your screen capture. For FFMPEG, scripting is necessary to get things working properly. 
        You can even pop up a webcam window with ffmpeg if you want to!
      </p>

      <h2>Wayland - wl-screenrec</h2>
      <p>
        I just recently came across this one. It's written in Rust (I don’t mind the language—except when it’s Python). 
        It uses GPU hardware acceleration too. It works without a script, but scripting it is the ideal way to use it. 
        Here’s the script I’m using:
      </p>

      <h4 style="font-family: monospace;">wl-screenrec script:</h4>
      <pre><code>
#!/usr/bin/env bash

set -e  # Stop on error

echo "Starting Screen Record"
echo "Press Ctrl+C to stop recording..."

timestamp="$(date +"recording-%Y-%m-%d-%H-%M-%S")"
output="${timestamp}.mp4"
final_output="${timestamp}-final.mp4"

# Start recording
wl-screenrec --audio --filename "$output"

# Boost audio
ffmpeg -i "$output" -filter:a "volume=3dB" "$final_output"

# Clean up original
rm "$output"

echo "Done. Output saved as $final_output"
</code></pre>

      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>
        Do not use OBS — use these minimalist, based programs instead!
